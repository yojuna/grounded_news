Open Source project to create a truly free version of ground news.

Project roadmap:
1. create a list of links of rss feeds of important/influential news sources
2. cluster news entries of the same stories
	- use text similarity algos initially; go for ml only if this does not work
3. curate news sources according to their position on the political spectrum
4. bundle as a mobile app
5. test heavily
6. UI/UX
7. publish

Hoping to get some traction and working on this project collaboratively.

NOTES:

There is no reason as to why we cannot have a clean, reliable news aggregator that works well.
